# Virtual Treatment Planner: Integrated Video Conferencing for Veterinary Clinic and Pet Shop Management System

**Capstone Project for University Requirements**

## Overview

The **Virtual Treatment Planner** system is designed to modernize veterinary care by integrating video conferencing into a treatment planning platform for veterinary clinics and pet shops. This project offers a seamless solution for remote veterinary consultations, allowing pet owners to access professional care from the comfort of their homes. By utilizing advanced video conferencing technology and a user-friendly interface, pet owners can easily register pets, schedule appointments, view prescriptions, and consult with veterinarians in real-time.

The system primarily focuses on consultations and prescription services, ensuring that pet owners receive expert advice without needing a physical visit to the clinic. This is particularly useful for follow-up checkups, non-emergency consultations, and clients with limited mobility or those living in distant locations.

## Purpose and Description

The purpose of this project is to address the evolving needs of veterinary medicine through technological innovation, making veterinary care more accessible and future-proof. By integrating a treatment planner with video conferencing, the system hopes to increase the relevance of veterinary care, prepare veterinarians for societal trends, and improve the overall pet care experience.

While not a pharmacy, the system facilitates online consultations and prescriptions, but does not dispense medications. The system's core is built around providing remote veterinary advice and prescriptions.

2. **Appointment Scheduling**: Enables users to schedule veterinary appointments with ease.
3. **Pet Management**: Facilitates pet registration and management, including essential information about the pet's health and history.
4. **Online Prescriptions**: Veterinarians can prescribe treatments or medications based on consultations, accessible through the platform.
5. **PayPal Integration**: Allows users to securely make payments for services using PayPal.
6. **Chat App**: Provides a chat feature for quick communication between pet owners and veterinarians.
7. **Audit Trails for Admin**: Ensures all actions, such as appointment creations, pet information updates, and transactions, are logged for accountability.
